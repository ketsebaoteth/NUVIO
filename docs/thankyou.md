# ðŸ“· About NUVIO

**NUVIO** is an open-source photo editor built with a clear purpose: to deliver a fast, stable, and cross-platform alternative to existing tools. Itâ€™s licensed under MIT and currently supports **Windows** and **Linux**. While **macOS** isnâ€™t supported yet due to hardware limitations, the codebase was written with macOS compatibility in mindâ€”so future support is very much on the horizon.

This project is in its early stages, but development is moving quickly. Every decisionâ€”from architecture to UIâ€”is guided by two core principles: **performance** and **stability**. No fluff, no bloatâ€”just a clean, efficient editor that respects your workflow.

## ðŸ§­ Why NUVIO Exists

Letâ€™s be honest: the current landscape of photo editors is... underwhelming. Photoshop remains dominant, but even it has room for improvement. And the alternatives? They often miss the mark entirelyâ€”slow, unstable, or simply not usable for serious work.

NUVIO was created to change that. Itâ€™s our answer to the lack of performant, reliable tools in this space. And itâ€™s built with the long game in mind.

## ðŸŒ± What We Believe

- Performance isnâ€™t optionalâ€”itâ€™s the baseline.  
- Stability is sacred.  
- Open-source should be elegant, not chaotic.  
- Cross-platform means *actually* cross-platform (eventually, macOSâ€”we see you).  
- Developers deserve tools that donâ€™t fight back.

## ðŸš§ Where Weâ€™re Headed

NUVIO is evolving fast. Weâ€™re refining the core, expanding platform support, and laying the groundwork for a plugin-friendly architecture that invites experimentation without sacrificing speed. Whether you're here to contribute code, file issues, or just poke aroundâ€”you're part of something that's growing with intention.

## ðŸ™Œ A Note to You

If you're reading this, thank you. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just curious, your interest means a lot. NUVIO isnâ€™t just a toolâ€”itâ€™s a shared effort to build something better. And weâ€™re glad youâ€™re here for it.
